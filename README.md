API built with .NET 6 and C# to complete Senai's fullstack bootcamp, which I participated in 2022.
<br/>
<br/>
The API is aimed at a training company registering its courses and students.
Courses are divided into topics and classes.
The API has protection through authentication via JWT Token. Login is required to access key endpoints.

<br/>
The database was mapped using annotations above the entities, using the code first concept. Also, it was versioned through migrations.
For mapping the entities in the database, the Entity Framework was used. The database, in turn, was Microsoft's SQL Server.

<br/>
The API also has documentation in swagger.
